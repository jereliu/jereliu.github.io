Welcome to Jeremiah's technical blog!

This blog is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) with full $\LaTeX$ support. For example:

$$f(\mathbf{x}) = (2\pi)^{-\frac{k}{2}} * |\Sigma|^{-\frac{1}{2}} exp((\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\mu})^T\Sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{\mu}))$$

The source code for the initial release is borrowed heavily from Will Townes' [awesome page](https://willtownes.github.io/) (thanks Will!).
