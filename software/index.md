-	[[GURLS_MKL]](https://github.com/jereliu/GURLS/tree/master/gurls) GURLS_MKL is a MATLAB tool for Multiple Kernel Learning under the [*Grand Unified Regularized Least Squares*](http://lcsl.mit.edu/#/downloads/gurls) (GURLS) package developed at MIT LCSL lab. GURLS_MKL uses Proximal Forward-Backward Projection method to solve the elastic-net regulated estimation problem, providing fast convergence and possibilities for alternative regularization methods (e.g. early stopping). For a complete documentation, including software structure, implementation details and usage, see [here](/download/code/GURLS_MKL.pdf).
