title: Hi, I'm Jeremiah

I'm a PhD student in [Biostatistics](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at Harvard University, where I do research on (Bayesian) machine learning, code [open source tools](/software/), and work with Professor [Brent Coull](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/brent-coull/) to teach machines eating funky data (say, piles of satellite images) to predict heavy metal pollutants in the air. 

I spend free time prototyping AI solutions for cost-efficient education and healthcare.

I love things that are <span style="color:black">elegantly simple</span> and <span style="color:black">deadly functional</span>, and never hesitate to  impose this aesthetic principle on all the things that I do.
