title: Hi, I'm Jeremiah
---


I'm a Research Engineer at [Google AI Language](https://ai.google/research/teams/language/) and a Visiting Scientist at [Harvard Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/). 

My research work focus on developing theoretical foundations for uncertainty quantification in machine learning procedures, and also on scalable algorithm for large-scale inference. At Google AI, I use my methods to enable AI agents to have better conversation and make better decision under uncertainty. At Harvard Biostatistics, I apply my method to environment/climate modelling and health effect estimation in large-scale epidemiological studies.

, where I work on exciting thesis projects on (Bayesian) machine learning, code [open source tools](/software/), and work with Professor [Brent Coull](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/brent-coull/) on large-scale spatio-temporal air pollution prediction and small-sample detection of nutrition-environment interaction, as well as good folks at [Martino Center](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/machinelearning) on various aspects of next-generation MRI technology.

I spend free time prototyping AI(mostly NLU)-oriented solutions for cost-efficient education.
