title: Hi, I'm Jeremiah

I'm a PhD student in [Biostatistics](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at Harvard University, where I take cool classes on statistics and machine intelligence, do research on statistical learning, code [open source tools](/software/), and work with Professor [Brent Coull](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/brent-coull/) to teach machines eat funky data (say, piles of satellite images) to predict heavy metal pollutants in the air.

<!--
i wrangle Pig, analyze in R and Python, power large-scale computation with C, and visualize in ggplot and d3.js. Shiny

I love things that are <span style="color:black">elegantly simple</span> and <span style="color:black">deadly functional</span>, and never hesitate to  impose this aesthetic principle on all the things that I do.
